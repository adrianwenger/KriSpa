Vocabulary training Program Spanish -- German

This program is based on a card box vocabulary training:
-- e.g  a word starts in box 0. If the user answers correctly, it will be put to box 1, this procedure continues till box 4.
   If the word was passed through the 5 boxes, it will be set to completed an will be never asked again, except the user sets  
   the word manually to another box.

-- The words with box identification number will be loaded an stored in a txt file located at the program directory, so if there    other languages want to be trained, just another words have to be added to the txt file.

-- learning the words in card box manner means, that words in lower boxes will be asked more times than words in upper boxes,   
   this is also implemented in KriSpa.
